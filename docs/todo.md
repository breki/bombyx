# TODO

Project work queue.

- `/todo <text>` captures a new item with a generated slug.
- `/todo` (no arguments) lists pending slugs.
- `/implement <slug>` plans and implements a pending item.
- `/implement` (no arguments) lists pending items and asks
  which to act on.

Each implemented item gets a planning doc at
`docs/issues/<slug>.md` that captures the problem statement,
plan, decisions, and outcome.

## Pending

- `wire-frosti` -- frosti is on WiFi, and VLAN tagging needs it wired.
  Prerequisite for the agent VLAN.
- `packer-box` -- bake a base box so `scratch` boots fast enough to use.
- `agent-vlan` -- isolate VMs on a VLAN with an egress allowlist.
  Enforced at the router.

- **phantom-deploy-command** -- cargo xtask deploy is documented but missing
  CLAUDE.md and .claude/commands/release.md and implement.md all describe cargo
  xtask deploy as the thing that gates shipping (it refuses unless HEAD is on a
  matching annotated tag), but no deploy subcommand exists in xtask -- it went
  with the template's deploy subsystem during the CLI-only prune. .gitignore
  still carries .deploy for the same reason. Either implement it or strip the
  references; leaving canon describing a gate that cannot run is worse than
  either.

- **reset-needs-snapshot** -- reset depends on a snapshot nothing creates
  bombyx reset runs vagrant snapshot restore fresh-install, but no bombyx
  command ever creates that snapshot. On a freshly booted VM the command fails
  with 'The snapshot name fresh-install was not found for the virtual machine
  default' and exit 1. The failure is clean and well surfaced -- verified live
  on frosti during first-real-run -- so this is a workflow gap rather than a
  bug. README.md documents reset as 'restore the fresh-install snapshot' without
  saying the operator must create it by hand first, which makes reset look like
  a working command on a new project when it cannot be. Options: add a bombyx
  command that takes the snapshot (snapshot save fresh-install) so the reset
  cycle is self-contained, or document that taking it is a manual step after the
  first successful up. The first is more useful: the snapshot should be taken at
  a known-good point, which is exactly after up completes.

- **done-links-may-dangle** -- todo done can write a dangling issue link
  cargo xtask todo done always renders the Done entry as
  [**slug**](issues/slug.md), whether or not that file exists. Items completed
  through /implement have a doc so the link resolves; anything closed outside
  that flow gets a dead link. Seen twice: first-real-run was hand-written into
  Done without a link precisely to dodge this, and todo-tooling-format-mismatch
  got an issue doc partly so the generated link would resolve. Options: omit the
  link when docs/issues/<slug>.md is absent, which needs an existence check
  passed in from the caller since move_to_done is otherwise pure over the
  markdown; or keep it unconditional and have /implement guarantee the doc
  exists before finalising. The second matches current intent but is enforced
  nowhere.

## Done

- [**doctor-preflight**](issues/doctor-preflight.md)
  -- bombyx doctor: read-only preflight checks
  (2026-08-10)

- [**discard-leaves-dir**](issues/discard-leaves-dir.md)
  -- discard now removes the scratch directory too
  (2026-08-10)

- [**destroy-project-vm**](issues/destroy-project-vm.md)
  -- destroy the project VM and remove its directory
  (2026-08-10)

- [**todo-tooling-format-mismatch**](issues/todo-tooling-format-mismatch.md)
  -- todo list and done now read backticked entries too
  (2026-08-10)

- **first-real-run** -- drove bombyx against a real libvirt host
  (frosti, Ubuntu 24.04, Vagrant 2.4.9, vagrant-libvirt 0.12.2).
  Full sequence exercised: `up`, `status`, `shell`, `down`,
  `scratch`, `discard`, `reset`, plus a second `up` for
  idempotency and a live traversal rejection. Confirmed the
  tilde fix, the tar-push (no nesting, `.vagrant` preserved,
  archive cleaned up) and project-scoped scratch dirs against
  reality. Turned up `discard-leaves-dir` and
  `reset-needs-snapshot`. (2026-08-10)
- [**drop-frontend-tooling**](issues/drop-frontend-tooling.md)
  -- Delete leftover frontend tooling from the CLI-only prune
  (2026-08-09)
