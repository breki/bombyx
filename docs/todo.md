# TODO

Project work queue.

- `/todo <text>` captures a new item with a generated slug.
- `/todo` (no arguments) lists pending slugs.
- `/implement <slug>` plans and implements a pending item.
- `/implement` (no arguments) lists pending items and asks
  which to act on.

Each implemented item gets a planning doc at
`docs/issues/<slug>.md` that captures the problem statement,
plan, decisions, and outcome.

## Pending

- `wire-frosti` -- frosti is on WiFi, and VLAN tagging needs it wired.
  Prerequisite for the agent VLAN.
- `packer-box` -- bake a base box so `scratch` boots fast enough to use.
- `agent-vlan` -- isolate VMs on a VLAN with an egress allowlist.
  Enforced at the router.

- **reset-needs-snapshot** -- reset depends on a snapshot nothing creates
  bombyx reset runs vagrant snapshot restore fresh-install, but no bombyx
  command ever creates that snapshot. On a freshly booted VM the command fails
  with 'The snapshot name fresh-install was not found for the virtual machine
  default' and exit 1. The failure is clean and well surfaced -- verified live
  on frosti during first-real-run -- so this is a workflow gap rather than a
  bug. README.md documents reset as 'restore the fresh-install snapshot' without
  saying the operator must create it by hand first, which makes reset look like
  a working command on a new project when it cannot be. Options: add a bombyx
  command that takes the snapshot (snapshot save fresh-install) so the reset
  cycle is self-contained, or document that taking it is a manual step after the
  first successful up. The first is more useful: the snapshot should be taken at
  a known-good point, which is exactly after up completes.

- **done-links-may-dangle** -- todo done can write a dangling issue link
  cargo xtask todo done always renders the Done entry as
  [**slug**](issues/slug.md), whether or not that file exists. Items completed
  through /implement have a doc so the link resolves; anything closed outside
  that flow gets a dead link. Seen twice: first-real-run was hand-written into
  Done without a link precisely to dodge this, and todo-tooling-format-mismatch
  got an issue doc partly so the generated link would resolve. Options: omit the
  link when docs/issues/<slug>.md is absent, which needs an existence check
  passed in from the caller since move_to_done is otherwise pure over the
  markdown; or keep it unconditional and have /implement guarantee the doc
  exists before finalising. The second matches current intent but is enforced
  nowhere.

- **host-network-isolation** -- apply and verify the nftables rules on frosti
  docs/vm-host-setup.md now documents an nftables ruleset that keeps agent VMs
  off the home LAN, the tailnet, Docker and the VM host's own services, while
  leaving outbound internet working. It is marked unverified: the rules were
  derived from frosti's actual network layout (virbr1 on 192.168.121.0/24, host
  on 192.168.1.10 via wlp4s0, plus tailscale0 and docker0) but have not been
  applied, because sudo on frosti needs a password and cannot run from a bombyx
  session. Run `agent-vm-firewall apply`, then the in-VM verification snippet
  including the IPv6 check, then `persist` -- and reboot and run `status`, since
  persistence is the one part that cannot be confirmed any other way and fails
  silently. Only then drop the unverified marker from the heading. Watch for two
  things the review flagged as untested in both directions: whether the input
  drop breaks anything the guest starts against the host, and whether `nft -c`
  accepts the generated ruleset on this nft version. This is a host-level
  stopgap for agent-vlan, not a replacement: enforcement sits on the machine
  being protected.

- **suspend-resume-commands** -- save and restore VM RAM state mid-task
  Add `bombyx suspend` / `bombyx resume` subcommands wrapping `vagrant suspend`
  / `vagrant resume`, so a VM's RAM state can be saved and restored mid-task.
  Context: `down` maps to `vagrant halt` (plan.rs:90), which is a graceful
  power-off -- the disk survives but running processes, tmux sessions and
  listening ports do not. There is currently no way to pick up mid-task after
  stopping a VM.

- **remote-clone-project-source** -- guest clones the repo, no host copy
  Today `bombyx up` needs the project checked out on the workstation, and it
  pushes `vagrant/` to the VM host. Project files therefore sit on two machines
  that are not the VM. The decision recorded in `issues/trust-boundary-doc.md`
  is that the guest is the only place project source exists, so neither the
  workstation nor the VM host clones it. Introduce a project-source
  abstraction: the workstation supplies a repository URL and a commit, and the
  guest clones the repo after boot. This depends on `generate-vagrantfile`.
  Vagrant needs the Vagrantfile before the VM exists, so it cannot come from
  the project repo and bombyx has to generate it. The guest also needs a
  credential to clone a private repo. The same document accepts that as a
  scoped exposure.

- **minimal-vagrantfile** -- strip project logic to boot + bootstrap hook
  Reduce the Vagrantfile to infrastructure only: provider, base box, CPUs,
  memory, and a single generic bootstrap provisioner that calls into bombyx.
  Everything project-specific moves out. A short Vagrantfile is also easier to
  keep identical across Windows and Linux hosts, since provider-specific
  features are what turn it into a nest of conditionals.

- **provision-lifecycle-hooks** -- named hooks replace one bash provision script
  Provisioning is currently one bash script run by Vagrant at VM creation.
  Replace it with named lifecycle hooks a project declares in a small manifest:
  prepare, dependencies, agent, cleanup. Vagrant then only creates the VM and
  runs the bootstrap; bombyx runs the hooks inside the guest. Simple projects
  implement one hook, complex ones several, and bombyx stays generic. It also
  decouples the hooks from Vagrant, so the backend can change later without
  touching them.

- **per-host-resource-profiles** -- detect host capacity, merge project minimums
  The same project run on a workstation and on a laptop should not get the same
  VM. Let the project declare its needs (minimum memory, minimum CPUs) and let
  each host contribute what it can provide. Detect RAM, CPU cores and hypervisor
  when a host is first used, apply a default policy such as half of RAM, and
  allow a per-host override file. Named profiles are the other half: a profile
  maps to a large allocation on the workstation and a smaller one on the laptop.

- **status-endpoint** -- read-only per-host VM status over the network
  There is no overview of what is running across machines. Each bombyx
  installation could expose a small read-only endpoint reporting its VMs, their
  projects, state and resource usage. Read-only keeps the autonomy of the
  current design: no central registry, no service to keep alive, no single point
  of failure. Report two distinct roles per VM, since they differ in this setup:
  the controller, meaning the instance that launched it, and the executor,
  meaning the host it actually runs on. Bind it to the private network only.

- **status-all-aggregator** -- bombyx status --all queries the known hosts
  The consumer of the per-host status endpoints. The client initiates: no
  background chatter, no instances polling each other. Discovery starts as a
  static config file listing the other hosts, which is dull and reliable; keep
  the lookup behind an interface so a tailnet or Consul provider can be added
  later without changing callers. The CLI is the first consumer, a dashboard is
  possible afterwards.

  Full sequence exercised: `up`, `status`, `shell`, `down`,
  `scratch`, `discard`, `reset`, plus a second `up` for
  idempotency and a live traversal rejection. Confirmed the
  tilde fix, the tar-push (no nesting, `.vagrant` preserved,
  archive cleaned up) and project-scoped scratch dirs against
  reality. Turned up `discard-leaves-dir` and
  `reset-needs-snapshot`. (2026-08-10)
